Basicly plug-in an Arduino to you computer, wire it through the breadboard with the ATtiny chip.
The PIN is mapped accodring to following table

Arduino PIN 	ATTiny 2313 PIN
10 		1 – RST
11 		17 – MOSI
12 		18 – MISO
13 		19 – SCK


Connect +5V and ground (from Arduino or anywhere else) to ATtiny PIN 20 and 10.

Connect the 10uF capacitor between Arduino RESET and GROUND.

Connect the 100Ω resistor and LED diode (serial) between the ATtiny PIN 2 and ground.

Download the arduino-tiny package and use it according your OS.

Open Arduino IDE and open File->Examples->ArduinoISP, compile it and Upload to the Arduino. Connect the 10uF capacitor between Reset (longer leg) and Ground Arduino PINs. Now it serves as a programmer to the ATtiny. Change the Tools->Board->ATtiny2313@1MHz, open the File->Examples->Basics->Blink and change the PIN 13 to 1.
Compile and upload.

The LED should start blink now.

Make the following connections. You need to be sure that you are connecting these to the ATtiny's actual pins (starting from the top left and counting up counter-clockwise) and not the name of the pin.

Arduino--------Attiny2313
  |                   |
13------------>19
12------------>18
11------------>17
10------------>1
5v------------>20 VCC
GND-------->10 GND

Also add an LED with a resistor on the pin (#7) right next to the GND on the ATtiny2313

Now that we know where the various ISP pins of the header and the chip are, we can wire things up. 
We need six wires (obviously)– hook MISO to MISO, MOSI to MOSI, and so on, and solder up the lines. 
Remember to index the header from the end that you marked earlier, the end with pin 1.

That’s actually all there is to it– the rest is just icing.
